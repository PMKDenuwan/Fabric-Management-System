📌 Fabric Management – Complete Well-Organized Description (with CRUD + Actual Production)

The Fabric Management Module manages all fabric-related operations inside ZYENTRA.
It includes recording new fabric purchases, calculating expected production, updating actual production, editing details, monitoring discounts, and viewing all records in a table.

1. General Fabric Information (CREATE)

When adding a new fabric entry, the system captures:

Fabric Name

Fabric Height

Fabric Price Per Yard

Apparel Length (in inches)

Num. of Yards (direct or via rolls)

Expected Items (auto-calculated)

Discount Details (if any)

Total Amount

After submission → data is saved to database.

2. Production Calculation
✔ Standard Conversion

1 yard = 36 inches

✔ Expected Items Formula
Expected Items
=
Number of Yards
×
36
Apparel Length
Expected Items=
Apparel Length
Number of Yards×36
	​


This represents the planned number of items that can be made from the fabric.

3. Quantity Selection Options
Option A – Number of Yards

User enters yards directly.

Option B – Number of Rolls

User enters rolls and:
✔ Yards per Roll (50, 52, 55, etc.)

System computes:

Total Yards
=
Rolls
×
Yards per Roll
Total Yards=Rolls×Yards per Roll
4. Discount Handling Logic
Receive Discount? → Yes / No
If No
Total Amount
=
Price per Yard
×
Number of Yards
Total Amount=Price per Yard×Number of Yards
If Yes – choose one:
1) Overall Fabric Discount
Total Amount
=
(
Price per Yard
×
Yards
)
−
Overall Discount
Total Amount=(Price per Yard×Yards)−Overall Discount
2) Discount per Yard
Total Amount
=
Discounted Price per Yard
×
Yards
Total Amount=Discounted Price per Yard×Yards
3) Discount per Roll
Total Amount
=
Discount per Roll
×
Rolls
Total Amount=Discount per Roll×Rolls
5. Cost Comparison Display

System shows:

✔ Original Amount
Price per Yard
×
Number of Yards
Price per Yard×Number of Yards
✔ Discounted Amount

(according to selected method)

✔ Final Total Amount

This helps verify supplier pricing.
