📌 Fabric Management – Well Organized Description

The Fabric Management Module handles all operations related to fabrics purchased by ZYENTRA. It records fabric details, calculates expected production, and computes total cost with or without discounts.

1. General Fabric Information

The system should capture the basic details of each purchased fabric:

Fabric Name

Fabric Height

Fabric Price Per Yard

Apparel Length (in inches) – fixed measurement of the item they produce

Number of Yards (auto-calculated from rolls if rolls option is selected)

2. Production Calculation

Using the standard conversion:

1 yard = 36 inches

The system calculates:

Expected Items
Formula:

Expected Items
=
Number of Yards
×
36
Apparel Length
Expected Items=
Apparel Length
Number of Yards×36
	​


This gives the approximate number of items that can be produced from the purchased fabric.

3. Fabric Quantity Selection

Users can choose how they want to input the quantity:

Option A – Number of Yards

User enters Num. of Yards directly.

Option B – Number of Rolls

User enters Num. of Rolls.

System asks: “How many yards in 1 roll?” (Roll sizes vary: 50, 52, 55 yards…)

Total yards = rolls × yards-per-roll

This yard value is used for all price and production calculations.

4. Discount Handling

A toggle/radio button:
Receive Discount? → Yes / No

If NO

Total Amount = Price per yard × Number of yards

If YES

Three discount types are visible (radio buttons):

1) Discount for Overall Fabric

Total Amount =

(
Price per yard
×
Number of yards
)
−
Overall Discount Amount
(Price per yard×Number of yards)−Overall Discount Amount
2) Discount Per Yard

User enters discounted price per yard

Total Amount =

Discounted price per yard
×
Number of yards
Discounted price per yard×Number of yards
3) Discount Per Roll

Used when fabric is purchased as rolls

Total Amount =

Discount per roll
×
Number of rolls
Discount per roll×Number of rolls
5. Cost Comparison Display

The system must clearly show:

Original Amount
(Price per yard × Number of yards)

vs.

Discounted Amount
(Calculation based on the discount type selected)

This helps ZYENTRA monitor savings and verify supplier invoices.
