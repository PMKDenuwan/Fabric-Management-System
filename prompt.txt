Hey I need to develop system for the 'ZYENTRA' Apparel Store for managing the internal procedure. I have already find the system requiremnts.NOw I need to develop each main sections/functions step by step. I have to choose the path as first develop first section/function with both frontend and backend integration with database.

**Here I choose the stack as MERN

First Section/Function :
Fabric Management
Here need to manage information about the fabric that they bought, expected produced items, actual produced items.
There is a scenario.
When ZYENTRA team buying fabrics, they already have width of the their designed item/cloth.

Fabric Name :                          Fabric Height:
Fabric Price Per Yard:                 
There are two options,(use radio buttons)
Num. of Yards: 
Num. of Rolls:   (Normally 1 roll have 50, 52, 55 yards We need to monitor this ) | How many yards for 1 roll
   1 yard = 36 inches
Receive Discount:Yes/No     
If yes : There are three options (use radio buttons):
1)Discount for overall fabric :
2)Discount for per yard :
3)Discount for per roll :
If NO: directly calculate the price per yards * num. of yards for the Total Amount

Total Amount:
This Total amount can be vary based on,
   If user select Num. of Yards * and discount no = directly calculate the amount -> price per yards * num. of yards
   If user select Num. of Yards * and discount yes with Discount for overall fabric = calculate the amount -> (price per yards * num. of yards)-Discount for overall fabric 
   (need to shows every steps)
   If user select Num. of Yards * and discount yes with Discount for per yard =  calculate the amount -> discounted price per yards * num. of yards
   If user select Num. of Yards * and discount yes with Discount for the roll =  calculate the amount -> discounted roll * num. of rolls
Need to clearly show how original amount ( price per yards * num. of yards) vs discounted amount

Here I clearly give again what are the fields that I need under fabric management:

Fabric Name :                               
Fabric Height :
Fabric Price Per Yard:  

  Apparel length (inches):65 inches             |num. of Yards:15 yards                 |Expected Items:(15*36)/65      


visible two options using radio buttons,
   Num. of Yards:         or         Num. of Rolls:
when user clicks one of them dynimaclly generate field for user typing
Receive Discount : Yes/No
   Discount for overall fabric :    or      Discount for per yard :         or       Discount for per roll :
Total Amount :

This is only the CREATE part from the CRUD.
Read -> Need to show collected data as table.
Update -> User can be enter data about actual produce items.
and also update the particular row
Delete -> user can delete row

These are the main things that need to manage.
   
This is what I need to do 

You need to well describe this in proper manner like a business analyst explain to the reqirement to the developer.
You need to clearly defined the requiremnets and how do it
You need to tell how to develop this step by step to the developer.

First give the full description.
Then give instructions how to develop this requirement step by step both frontend and backend  with integrating database

Note : Here I attached sample view of the table
